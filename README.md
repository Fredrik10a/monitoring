# Metrics and Monitoring Experiment (Basic setup)

Welcome to the Metrics and Monitoring Experiment project! üöÄ This project serves as a playground for experimenting with various metrics and monitoring tools.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore and integrate components related to metrics, monitoring, and distributed systems. The project utilizes popular tools such as Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Prometheus, and RabbitMQ.

## Components üõ†Ô∏è

### Elasticsearch

- **Purpose:** Indexing and searching metrics data.
- **Configuration:** See `Dockerfile.elasticsearch`.

### Kibana

- **Purpose:** Visualizing and exploring metrics data.
- **Configuration:** See `Dockerfile.kibana`.

### Logstash

- **Purpose:** Collecting, processing, and forwarding logs and metrics.
- **Configuration:** See `Dockerfile.logstash`.

### Prometheus

- **Purpose:** Monitoring and alerting.
- **Configuration:** See `Dockerfile.prometheus`.

### RabbitMQ

- **Purpose:** Message broker for distributed systems.
- **Configuration:** See `Dockerfile.rabbitmq`.
